        <h1 id="can-ml-predict-where-my-cat-is-now--part-1">Can ML predict where my cat is now — part 1</h1>
<p>It’s 9am on a rainy Tuesday morning — can a simple ML model predict where my cat will be sleeping? How I used a bluetooth tracker, a dozen microcontrollers plus a bit of Python to predict where Snowy the cat would be napping in the next hour.</p>
<p><img src="202002cat.jpg" alt="Predicting where Snowy the cat is likely to be based on time and weather"></p>
<p><em>Predicting where Snowy the cat is likely to be based on time and weather</em></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>With some inexpensive hardware (and a cat ambivalent to data privacy concerns) I wanted to see if I could train a machine learning (ML) model to predict where Snowy would go throughout her day.</p>
<p>Home based location &amp; temperature tracking allowed me to build up an extensive history of which room she used for her favourite sleeping spots. I had a theory with sufficient data collected I’d be able to train an ML model to predict where the cat was likely to be.</p>
<p>This two part blog describes the hardware and software necessary to collect the data, build a prediction model and test the real-world accuracy of cat behaviour estimation. This first blog describes the hardware and data collection, and part 2 describes building the prediction model</p>
<h2 id="hardware-for-room-level-cat-tracking">Hardware for room level cat tracking</h2>
<p>The first task was to collect a <em>lot</em> of data on where Snowy historically spent her time — along with environmental factors such as temperature &amp; rainfall. I set an arbitrary target of collecting hourly updates for around three months of movement in and around the house.</p>
<p><img src="00000001.png" alt="Finding the room Snowy is in relies on a base station in each likely location"></p>
<p><em>Finding the room Snowy is in relies on a base station in each likely location</em></p>
<p>Cat’s aren’t great at data entry; so I needed an automated way of collecting her location. I asked Snowy to wear a <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/products">Tile</a> — a small, battery powered bluetooth tracker. This simply transmits a regular and unique BLE signal. I then used eight stationary receivers to listen for the BLE Tile signal. These receiver nodes were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a> based presence detection nodes each running <a href="https://espresense.com/">ESPresense</a>. The nodes were placed in named rooms in and around the house (6 inside, 2 outside).</p>
<p><img src="00000002.png" alt="A collection of ESP32 modules and a BLE Tile (white square)"></p>
<p><em>A collection of ESP32 modules and a BLE Tile (white square)</em></p>
<p>Each node constantly looking for the unique BLE signal of Snowy’s tile and measuring the received signal strength indicator (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication">RSSI</a>). The stronger the signal, the closer Snowy is to that beacon (either that, or she’s messing with the battery). If I got a few seconds of strong signal next to the study sensor for example, I could assume Snowy was likely very close to that room.</p>
<p>Each ESP32 module is powered by a micro-usb power supply and communicate back to the base station by joining the home WiFi network. The networking is important as multiple receivers can simultaneously receive a signal — and they need to determine which base station has the “strongest” signal.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-for-logging-environmental-information">Hardware for logging environmental information</h2>
<p>Snowy avoids the outside garden when it rains, and tends to fall asleep in the warm (but not hot) rooms of the house. I wanted to collect environmental conditions, as I figured temperature and rainfall would play a significant role in determining where Snowy would hang out.</p>
<p><img src="00000003.png" alt="Xiaomi Aqara Temperature and Humidity Sensors">
<em>Xiaomi Aqara Temperature and Humidity Sensors</em></p>
<p>I selected the <a href="https://www.xiaomiproducts.nl/fr/xiaomi-aqara-temperature-and-humidity-sensor.html">Xiaomi Temperature and Humidity Sensor</a> as they run for months on a battery, and communicate over large distances via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> wireless mesh network. I placed these sensors throughout the house and in two external locations to capture outside conditions</p>
<h2 id="integration--building-a-data-collection-platform">Integration — building a data collection platform</h2>
<p>For the data collection platform I used <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> running on a Raspberry Pi. Home Assistant is a free and open-source software for home automation that is designed to be the central control system for smart home devices. I was able to track Snowy’s location via the <a href="https://espresense.com/home_assistant">binary sensor</a> configuration. Essentially the room based beacon receiving the strongest signal from Snowy’s BLE tile updates an MQTT topic with her current location.</p>
<p><img src="00000004.png" alt="Home Assistant display of location"></p>
<p><em>Home Assistant display of location</em></p>
<p>For temperature and humidity measurements, I used the Xiaomi integration to get a constant update of room level environment conditions. (Worthy of another blog: TL;DR flash the Xiaomi Zigbee hub with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee/">Tasmota</a>)</p>
<p><img src="00000005.png" alt="Home Assistant display of temperature and humidity"></p>
<p><em>Home Assistant display of temperature and humidity</em></p>
<p>The TL;DR summary — with the support of the amazing Home Assistant and Tasmota community I was able to gather accurate cat location along with fine grained temperature and humidity readings.</p>
<h2 id="data-preparation--extracting-data-from-home-assistant">Data preparation — extracting data from Home Assistant</h2>
<p>Home Assistant by default uses a SQLite database with a 10 day retention. I actually wanted to retain a lot more historic data to train the model. By modifying the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/">recorder integration</a> I pushed all the data storage into a Postgres database with 6 months of retention.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Home assistant stores each sensor update in the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/backend/database/">states</a> table. This is *really *fine-grained, with updates added every few seconds from all the sensors (in my case, around 18,000 sensor updates a day). My goal was to summarise the data into hourly updates — essentially a single (most prevalent) location, along with temperature and humidity readings.</p>
<p>I extracted the initial three months (SQL <a href="https://github.com/saubury/cat-predictor/blob/master/sql/extract.sql">here</a>) of hourly location and environmental conditions to train the model.</p>
<p><img src="00000006.png" alt="Extract of hourly location and environmental readings"></p>
<p><em>Extract of hourly location and environmental readings</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-next-in-part-2">What’s next in part 2</h2>
<p>This first blog described the the method for locating Snowy and data collection platform. The next blog will describe building the prediction model, and how accurate can a ML model be when determining where a cat is likely to be.</p>
